# Welcome to your Rork app

## Project info

This is a native cross-platform mobile app created with [Rork](https://rork.com)

**Platform**: Native iOS & Android app, exportable to web
**Framework**: Expo Router + React Native

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Use Rork**

Simply visit [rork.com](https://rork.com) and prompt to build your app with AI.

Changes made via Rork will be committed automatically to this GitHub repo.

Whenever you make a change in your local code editor and push it to GitHub, it will be also reflected in Rork.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Rork.

If you are new to coding and unsure which editor to use, we recommend Cursor. If you're familiar with terminals, try Claude Code.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the instant web preview of your Rork app in your browser, with auto-reloading of your changes
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with the most popular native mobile cross-platform technical stack:

- **React Native** - Cross-platform native mobile development framework created by Meta and used for Instagram, Airbnb, and lots of top apps in the App Store
- **Expo** - Extension of React Native + platform used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Telsa, Starlink, Eightsleep, and more
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing system for React Native with support for web, server functions and SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **Lucide React Native** - Beautiful icons

## How can I test my app?

### **On your phone (Recommended)**

1. **iOS**: Download the [Rork app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/rork) or [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
2. **Android**: Download the [Expo Go app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
3. Run `bun run start` and scan the QR code from your development server

### **In your browser**

Run `bun start-web` to test in a web browser. Note: The browser preview is great for quick testing, but some native features may not be available.

### **iOS Simulator / Android Emulator**

You can test Rork apps in Expo Go or Rork iOS app. You don't need XCode or Android Studio for most features.

**When do you need Custom Development Builds?**

- Native authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In)
- In-app purchases and subscriptions
- Push notifications
- Custom native modules

If you have XCode (iOS) or Android Studio installed:

```bash
# iOS Simulator
bun run start -- --ios

# Android Emulator
bun run start -- --android
```

# Install EAS CLI
bun i -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure your project for development builds
eas build:configure

# Create a development build for your device
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the development build on your device and start developing
bun start --dev-client
```

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
